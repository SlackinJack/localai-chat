# localai-chat

**Working: Very broken**

Very barebones basic front-end for LocalAI written in Python3

Current features (may change at any point):
- Paste weblinks into the prompt and interact with just about any website that has text.
- Read a PDF locally (very slow)
- Search duckduckgo based on generated search terms from your prompt, then answer your prompt based on what it found. (With sources!)

Current dependencies (may change at any point):
- BeautifulSoup4
- duckduckgo_search
- PyPDF2
- termcolor
